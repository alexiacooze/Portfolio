            This project was a 24 hour collaborative hackaton, in which the
            groups were given the opportunity to work with Canada GooseÂ©. The
            groups were given a presentation from the company on their beliefs,
            business plans, and recent additions. We were then asked to create a
            project that encompasses their company as a whole. My group chose to
            create an application that highlighted their desire for
            sustainability, online accessability and inclusivity. This project
            was front end specific, and was accomplished within 24 hours
